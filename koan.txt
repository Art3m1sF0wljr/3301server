A master who lived as a hermit on a mountain was asked by a
monk, "What is the Way?"
"What a fine mountain this is," the master said in reply
"I am not asking you about the mountain, but about the Way.
"So long as you cannot go beyond the mountain, my son, you
cannot reach the Way," replied the master
